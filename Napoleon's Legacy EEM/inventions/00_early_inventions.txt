#Better lubrication, such as from petroleum oils, reduced friction losses in mills and factories.[34] Anti-friction bearings were developed using alloy steels and precision machining techniques available in the last quarter of the 19th century. Anti-friction bearings were widely used on bicycles by the 1880s. Bearings began being used on line shafts in the decades before factory electrification and it was the pre-bearing shafts that were largely responsible for their high power losses, which were commonly 25 to 30% and often as much as 50%.[20] 

#Lubrication oil was an accidental discovery while attempting to distil kerosene. Everest noted the residue from the extraction was suitable as a lubricant. 
#Hiram Everest 1866 https://rbscp.lib.rochester.edu/sites/default/files/atoms/files/Epitaph37_1.pdf#In 1880 Vacuum was absorbed by Standard Oil and developed rapidly when lubricating oil was needed for the stationary engine, the automobile, and finally the electric generator, motor and transformer and the steam turbine.

#In the 1860s, magnetic separation started to become commercialized. It was used to separate iron from brass.[3]

#Tetraethyllead (commonly styled tetraethyl lead), abbreviated TEL, is an organolead compound with the formula (CH3CH2)4Pb. It is a petro-fuel additive, first being mixed with gasoline beginning in the 1920s as a patented octane rating booster that allowed engine compression to be raised substantially. This in turn caused increased vehicle performance and fuel economy.[3][4] TEL had been identified chemically in the mid-19th century, but its antiknock effectiveness was discovered in 1921 by the General Motors research laboratory, which had spent several years attempting to find an additive that was both highly effective and inexpensive.
#Concerns were later raised over the toxic effects of lead, especially on children. Lead also poisons catalytic converters and is a major cause of spark plug fouling.[5] From the 1970s many countries began phasing out and eventually banning TEL in automotive fuel. In 2011, a study backed by the United Nations estimated that the removal of TEL had resulted in $2.4 trillion in annual benefits, and 1.2 million fewer premature deaths.[6]
