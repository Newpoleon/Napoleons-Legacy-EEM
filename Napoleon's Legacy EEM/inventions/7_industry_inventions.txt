#Ljungström air preheater is an air preheater invented by the Swedish engineer Fredrik Ljungström (1875-1964). The patent was achieved in 1930.[1] 
#With Fredrik Ljungström's technology of the air preheater implemented in a vast amount of modern power stations around the world until this day with total attributed worldwide fuel savings estimated to 4,960,000,000 tons of oil, "few inventions have been as successful in saving fuel as the Ljungström Air Preheater". 
#"The first installation in a commercial boiler saved as much as 25% of the fuel consumption. In a modern utility boiler the Ljungström Air Preheater provides up to 20% of the total heat transfer in the boiler process, but the Ljungström Air Preheater only represents 2% of the investment." https://www.asme.org/wwwasmeorg/media/resourcefiles/aboutasme/who%20we%20are/engineering%20history/landmarks/185-ljungstrom-air-preheater.pdf

#The kraft (Swedish for strong) pulping process was commercialized in the 1930s
#The invention of the recovery boiler by G. H. Tomlinson in the early 1930s was a milestone in the advancement of the kraft process.[8] It enabled the recovery and reuse of the inorganic pulping chemicals such that a kraft mill is a nearly closed-cycle process with respect to inorganic chemicals, apart from those used in the bleaching process. For this reason, in the 1940s, the kraft process superseded the sulfite process as the dominant method for producing wood pulp.[7]

###### Rocketry
#Today, hydrogen peroxide is manufactured almost exclusively by the anthraquinone process, which was formalized in 1936 and patented in 1939.
#About 60% of the world's production of hydrogen peroxide is used for pulp- and paper-bleaching.[32] The second major industrial application is the manufacture of sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate, which are used as mild bleaches in laundry detergents. Sodium percarbonate, which is an adduct of sodium carbonate and hydrogen peroxide, is the active ingredient in such laundry products as OxiClean and Tide laundry detergent.
#It is used in the production of various organic peroxides with dibenzoyl peroxide being a high volume example. It is used in polymerisations, as a flour bleaching agent, and as a treatment for acne. Peroxy acids, such as peracetic acid and meta-chloroperoxybenzoic acid also are produced using hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide has been used for creating organic peroxide-based explosives, such as acetone peroxide. 
#Hydrogen peroxide may be used for the sterilization of various surfaces

#During World War II, high-test peroxide was used as an oxidizer in some German bipropellant rocket designs, such as the Walter HWK 509A rocket engine that powered the Messerschmitt Me 163 point defense interceptor fighter late in World War II, comprising 80% of the standardized mixture T-Stoff, and also in the German Type XVII submarine.

#The rate of penetration was about 30 % higher while drilling in Oklahoma
#Seismic exploration, beginning in the 1920s, uses reflected sound waves to map subsurface geology to help locate potential oil reservoirs. This was a great improvement over previous methods, which involved mostly luck and good knowledge of geology, although luck continued to be important in several major discoveries. Rotary drilling was a faster and more efficient way of drilling oil and water wells. It became popular after being used for the initial discovery of the East Texas field in 1930. 
#Numerous new hard materials were developed for cutting edges such as in machining. Mushet steel, which was developed in 1868, was a forerunner of High speed steel, which was developed by a team led by Fredrick Winslow Taylor at Bethlehem Steel Company around 1900.[71] High speed steel held its hardness even when it became red hot. It was followed by a number of modern alloys.
#From 1935 to 1955 machining cutting speeds increased from 120 to 200 ft/min to 1000 ft/min due to harder cutting edges, causing machining costs to fall by 75%.[97]
#One of the most important new hard materials for cutting is tungsten carbide. 

#In. 1928 Armenian oil delivery system engineer and inventor Armais Arutunoff successfully installed the first submersible oil pump in an oil field.[1] In 1929, Pleuger Pumps (today Pleuger Industries) developed the design of the submersible turbine pump, the forerunner of the modern multi-stage submersible pump.[2]

    #Tunnels only make up about 15% of the reserve, so during advance mining, only about 15% of the coal or ore is removed. During retreat mining, an additional 75% of coal or ore may be removed because pillars make up much more of the reserve, bringing the total recovery of the resource to as much as 90%.

#The history of numerical control (NC) began when the automation of machine tools first incorporated concepts of abstractly programmable logic, and it continues today with the ongoing evolution of computer numerical control (CNC) technology.
#The first NC machines were built in the 1940s and 1950s, based on existing tools that were modified with motors that moved the controls to follow points fed into the system on punched tape
#Arma's first automated lathe was made in 1948, and announced in 1950
