#Norden was initially unconvinced this was workable, but the Navy persisted and offered him a development contract in June 1929.[11] Norden retreated to his mother's house in Zurich and returned in 1930 with a working prototype. Lieutenant Frederick Entwistle, the Navy's chief of bombsight development, judged it revolutionary.[2]
#It was an early tachometric design that directly measured the aircraft's ground speed and direction, which older bombsights could only estimate with lengthy manual procedures
#Between 1932 and 1938, the company produced only 121 bombsights per year. During the first year after the Attack on Pearl Harbor (1941), Norden produced 6,900 bombsights

#Small numbers of SABS became available in early 1943 
#tachometric_bombsight
#In 1936 Royal Aircraft Establishment scientist Leslie Bennet Craigie Cunningham suggested using a gyroscope's resistance to rotation to modify the aiming point in a gun sight to compensate for deflection caused by a turning aircraft
#the first production gyro gunsight was the British Mark I Gyro Sight, developed at Farnborough in 1941.

#Guided weapons (by radio or trailing wires): glide bombs, crawling bombs and rockets – the precursors of today's precision-guided munitions existed between 1942–45, in the German Fritz X and Henschel Hs 293 anti-ship ordnance designs, which along with the American Azon, were all MCLOS radio-guided ordnance designs in World War II service.

#tracked bomb: France, June 1916. However, it performed poorly, wired guided
#The Wickersham Land Torpedo was patented by American inventor Elmer Wickersham in 1918[5] and in the 1930s, a similar vehicle was developed by the French vehicle designer Adolphe Kégresse. 
#Goliaths were used on all fronts where the Wehrmacht fought, beginning in early 1942
#Teletanks were a series of wireless remotely controlled unmanned tanks produced in the Soviet Union in the 1930s and early 1940s

#The Heinkel He 178 was the world's first aircraft to fly under turbojet power, and the first practical jet aircraft. It was a private venture by the German Heinkel company in accordance with director Ernst Heinkel's emphasis on developing technology for high-speed flight. It first flew on 27 August 1939
#The Messerschmitt Me 262, nicknamed Schwalbe (German: "Swallow") in fighter versions, or Sturmvogel (German: "Storm Bird") in fighter-bomber versions, was the world's first operational jet-powered fighter aircraft. Design work started before World War II began, but problems with engines, metallurgy and top-level interference kept the aircraft from operational status with the Luftwaffe until mid-1944.
