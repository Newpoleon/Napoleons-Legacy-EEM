prevent_warlord_era_desc;The devolution of power during the late 19th century has created cliques of powerful military governors with their own private armies. By giving meaningless posts to some and dismissing or arresting others, we can prevent potential revolts and better centralize our nation. It will take a few years before the administration can find replacements for everyone dismissed, but this threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ unity should be suppressed before it is too late..;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peking_convention_RTR_title;The Peking Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;;
peking_convention_RTR_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
