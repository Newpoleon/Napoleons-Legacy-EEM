GC_NAME;La Grande Campagne;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
GC_DESC;The last wounds of the Napoleonic Wars have finally healed, and all over Europe, nations prepare their men to fight and die once more. France, still the master of the Continent, shines brighter than ever before due to the brilliance of Napoleon Bonaparte and the legacy he left behind. French influence has spread all over Europe, bringing the Ancien Regimes crashing down and building enlightened institutions in their place. Yet these new liberal ideas are not easily controlled. Nationalism has spread far and wide, and peoples across Europe are awakening to their common culture and identity. In the Americas, the exiled Hanoverian dynasty has recovered from the revolution in Britain that sent them across the sea. Princess Victoria is 16 years old, and will soon ascend to the throne of the British Empire; her ascension, to a long and tumultuous reign, marks the beginning of an age that is to last all the way up until the First Great War. In this new era of unprecedented technological progress, the new and old nations of Europe must fight to maintain their power and influence from the forces of nationalism and still newer ideologies that promise a better future than what liberalism can bring. Far away, across the briny foam, the riches of Asia and Africa, and The Heart of Darkness, beckon that their songs may also be heard in the Concert of Europe. Maestro, choose your instrument, and let the music play.;;;;;;;;;x;;;;;;;;
