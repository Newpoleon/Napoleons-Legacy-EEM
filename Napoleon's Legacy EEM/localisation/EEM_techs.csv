leaded_gasoline;Petrol-Fuel Additives;;;;;;;;;;;;;
leaded_gasoline_desc;Tetraethyllead, abbreviated TEL, is a fuel additive that substantially improved vehicle performance and fuel economy by preventing engine knock and reducing valve wear. For mixing with raw gasoline, TEL was most commonly supplied in the form of "Ethyl Fluid", which consisted of TEL blended with 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,2-dibromoethane. It is highly toxic, with as little as 6 mL being enough to induce severe lead poisoning.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rubber_n_plastic_additives;Rubber and Plastic Additives;;;;;;;;;;;;;

self_propelled_artillery;Self-Propelled Artillery;;;;;;;;;;;;;
self_propelled_artillery_desc;The key advantage of self-propelled over towed artillery is that it can be brought into action much faster. Before the towed artillery can be used, it has to stop, unlimber and set up the guns. To move position, the guns must be limbered up again and brought—usually towed—to the new location. By comparison, self-propelled artillery can stop at a chosen location and begin firing almost immediately, then quickly move on to a new position. This shoot-and-scoot ability is very useful in a mobile conflict and particularly on the advance.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rocket_artillery;Rocket Artillery;;;;;;;;;;;;;
rocket_artillery_desc;Rockets have been used in warfare ever since they were invented in medieval China. By the late nineteenth century, however, the use of military rockets declined due to improvements in the power and range of conventional artillery.

This new class of tank was called the main battle tank, which soon replaced almost all other types of tanks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
semi_automatic_rifle_armament;Semi-Automatic Rifle Main Armament;;;;;;;;;;;;;
semi_automatic_rifle_armament_desc;Semi-automatic rifles use part of the fired cartridge's energy to eject the case and load another cartridge into the chamber and could fire much faster than bolt-action rifles.

erik_lindahl;Erik Lindahl;;;;;;;;;;;;;
erik_lindahl_desc;Erik Lindahl posed the question of financing public goods in accordance with individual benefits. A Lindahl tax is a form of taxation in which people pay for public goods according to the amount of satisfaction or utility they derive from the consumption of an additional unit of the public good. If each person's tax price is set equal to the marginal benefits received at the ideal service level, each person is made better off by provision of the public good and may accordingly agree to have that service level provided. A Lindahl equilibrium describes how efficiency can be sustained in an economy with such taxes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;

kraft_pulping;Kraft Pulping;;;;;;;;;;;;;
kraft_pulping_desc;In the kraft process, wood chips are steamed then saturated with white liquor, a mixture of sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide, and cooked in pressurized digestors to produce pulp. The leftover fluid, known as black liquor, is concentrated and sodium hydroxide and sodium sulfide are regenerated by chemical processes, which also creates high pressure steam that can be used to generate electricty. Overall, it is a nearly closed-cycle process, a major advantage over the older sulfite process.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
